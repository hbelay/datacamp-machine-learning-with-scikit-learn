## 1- Supervised learning

In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. You'll do so using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.

## 2- Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.

## 3- Linear Classifiers in Python

In this course you'll learn all about using linear classifiers, specifically logistic regression and support vector machines, with scikit-learn. Once you've learned how to apply these methods, you'll dive into the ideas behind them and find out what really makes them tick. At the end of this course you'll know how to train, test, and tune these linear classifiers in Python. You'll also have a conceptual foundation for understanding many other machine learning algorithms.
